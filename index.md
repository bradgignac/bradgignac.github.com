**Hi, I'm Brad Gignac**. I'm a Christian, software developer, and open source
contributor. Currently, I work at [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com) on the
[Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com). Outside of work, you'll
find me exploring the world of craft beer, enjoying fine coffee, and contributing
to [open source](https://github.com/bradgignac). I live in the New River Valley.

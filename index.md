**Hello, my name is Brad Gignac**. I'm a Christian, husband, and father living in beautiful Charlotte, NC. In my spare time, you'll find me spending time with my family, enjoying great music, and [cozying up with a good book](/reading-list). In my professional life, I work as a software developer at [Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com) building tooling that helps our customers manage infrastructure running on [AWS](https://www.rackspace.com/managed-aws), [GCP](https://www.rackspace.com/managed-google-cloud), and [Azure](https://www.rackspace.com/microsoft/managed-azure-cloud). Previously, I spent time working on the [Mailgun](http://mailgun.com) and [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com) teams.

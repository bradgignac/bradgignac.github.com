**Hello, my name is Brad Gignac**. I'm a Christian, husband, father, and software
developer living and working in the New River Valley. Currently, I work at
[Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com) building the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com).
When I'm not building software, you'll find me spending time with my family,
exploring the world of craft beer, and enjoying the great outdoors.

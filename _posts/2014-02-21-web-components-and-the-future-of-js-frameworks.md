title: Web Components and the Future of JS Frameworks
---

Over the last ten years, the web has given birth to hundreds of different
Javascript libraries and frameworks, all aimed at making web application development
quicker and easier. While these frameworks have let us build great web applications,
they have left the web fragmented - frameworks represent a platform unto themselves
with almost zero interoperability.

Web components represent a cross-framework method for building composable, reusable
widgets that work anywhere on the web, independent of any framework. This talk gives
a technical overview of web components and discusses how they will impact the future
of Javascript frameworks.

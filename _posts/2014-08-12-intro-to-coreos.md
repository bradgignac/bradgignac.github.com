title: Intro to CoreOS
---

This talk and accompanying demo gives an overview of CoreOS and tools in the 
surrounding ecosystem such as Docker, nspawn, etcd, fleet, and vulcand. It also
provides a working demo of a three-machine CoreOS cluster that uses vulcand to 
load balance HTTP requests to Docker containers scheduled with fleet. See 
[bradgignac/intro-to-coreos](https://github.com/bradgignac/intro-to-coreos) for
the source code.
